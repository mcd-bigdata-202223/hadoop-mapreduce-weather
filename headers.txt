The station WBAN number. The Local Standard Time (LST) year/month of the observation. The version number of the station datalogger program that was in effect at the end of the month. Note: This field should be treated as text (i.e. string). Station longitude, using WGS-84, with a precision of 4 decimal places. Station latitude, using WGS-84, with a precision of 4 decimal places. The maximum air temperature, in degrees C. See Note F. The minimum air temperature, in degrees C. See Note F. The mean air temperature, in degrees C, calculated using the typical historical approach of (T_MONTHLY_MAX + T_MONTHLY_MIN) / 2. See Note F. The average air temperature, in degrees C. See Note F. The total amount of precipitation, in mm. See Note G. The average daily total solar energy received, in MJ/meter^2. See Note H. Type of infrared surface temperature measurement: 'R' denotes raw (uncorrected), 'C' denotes corrected, and 'U' is unknown/missing. See Note I. The maximum infrared surface temperature, in degrees C. See Note J. The minimum infrared surface temperature, in degrees C. See Note J. The average infrared surface temperature, in degrees C. See Note J.
